Idea and sample taken from metanit tutorial for [web api](https://metanit.com/sharp/aspnet5/23.2.php). Tried not to copy the code blindly.

Test project contains both server and client parts. Download, open in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and run.

## Server
* Visual Studio 2019 project from ASP.NET Core Web API template
* Simple get/post/put/delete handler
* Objects stored in localdb, used EF
* Model validation

## Client
* Bootstrap layout
* Pure JS (Fetch API)
